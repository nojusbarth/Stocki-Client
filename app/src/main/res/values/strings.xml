    <string name="explanation_MAE_title">Mean Absolute Error (MAE)</string>
    <string name="explanation_MAE_body">
        Measures the average absolute difference between predicted and actual returns.\n
        \nA lower MAE indicates more accurate predictions.
    </string>
    <string name="explanation_MAE_example">
        Example:\n
        \nAn MAE of 2.5 % means predictions deviate by ~2.5 percentage points on average.
    </string>

    <string name="explanation_hit_rate_title">Hit Rate</string>
    <string name="explanation_hit_rate_body">
        Shows how often the model correctly predicts the direction of movement (up or down).\n
        \nHigher is better.
    </string>
    <string name="explanation_hit_rate_example">
        Example:\n
        \nA Hit Rate of 70 % means the model was right 7 out of 10 times.
    </string>

    <string name="explanation_sharpe_title">Sharpe Ratio (annually)</string>
    <string name="explanation_sharpe_body">
        Measures risk-adjusted performance —\n
        the ratio of excess return to volatility.\n
        \nValues above 1.0 are considered good, above 2.0 excellent.
    </string>
    <string name="explanation_sharpe_example">
        Example:\n
        \nA Sharpe Ratio of 1.8 indicates strong returns relative to risk.
    </string>

    <string name="explanation_drawdown_title">Maximum Drawdown</string>
    <string name="explanation_drawdown_body">
        Shows the largest price drop for this stock during the evaluation period —\n
        it measures how much the price fell from its highest point to the lowest afterwards.\n
        \nSmaller (less negative) values mean lower risk.
    </string>

    <string name="explanation_drawdown_example">
        Example:\n
        \nA Max Drawdown of –12 % means the stock price once dropped 12 % from its recent peak before recovering.
    </string>

    <string name="explanation_confidence_title">Model Confidence Score</string>
    <string name="explanation_confidence_body">
        Combines multiple performance metrics into a single measure of historical model performance.\n
        The score reflects how consistent and accurate the model’s predictions were during training.\n
        \nIt is not a guarantee of future predictions.
    </string>
    <string name="explanation_confidence_example">
        Example:\n
        \nA Confidence Score of 80 indicates that the model performed well on historical data,
        while a score of 20 indicates lower historical performance.\n
        These values do not guarantee future results.
